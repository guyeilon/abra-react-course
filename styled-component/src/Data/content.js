There are just as many or more new and upcoming ways to define colors than what we have now. I thought we’d take a really quick look. \n \n First, a major heads up. This stuff is so complicated. I barely understand it. But here are some aspects:\n \n <ul><li>Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB as a color model, and everything dealt with that.</li>
		<li>We had different “color spaces” that handled it differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that RGB color model as a cube with linear coordinates, the hsl() function mapped that RGB color model as a cylinder) but it was all sRGB gamut.</li><li>With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color models and (!) we’re getting new functions that map that color model differently. So I think it’s kind of a double-triple whammy.</li></ul></p>`,
